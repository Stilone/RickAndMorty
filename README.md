## Description:
This project served as a test assignment during my application process with a company, albeit one that did not result in a successful offer. Further research revealed that my approach to API requests might have been a bit convoluted, but the competition included individuals with extensive experience. Despite not securing the position, I remained undeterred.

In this project, I implemented server requests to retrieve characters from the Rick and Morty series. Users can filter characters, view individual character cards, and observe the status of each character through indicator-colored icons denoting whether they are alive, deceased, or unknown. Additionally, I added a gif animation featuring Rick's face during the character loading process.

This project marked the culmination of my self-directed learning journey. Subsequently, I delved deep into theoretical concepts, eventually landing a position in a company. If you've made it this far and explored all my projects, you're doing great! To any aspiring developer, I encourage you not to give up and pursue your goals, just as I did. Best of luck!

Remember, "The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."
